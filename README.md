# Simple model-view pattern
Android model-view pattern to preserve configuration changes
  
# Abstract
A demo for a simple model-view pattern to survive configuration changes  
without need for serialization/deserialization of the activity state  
or using an additional framework.  
All state related data are kept in a static class which is tied to  
the  application life cycle, instead of the activity one.
